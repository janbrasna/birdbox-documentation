# About this project

[Birdbox](https://github.com/mozmeao/birdbox) is a kit for building on-brand, easily editable microsites quickly.

It was developed by the Marketing Engineering team to save us time and to put more control over content in the hands of the relevant project’s teams.

Birdbox aims to be a full-stack solution. It brings together three key aspects:

* Wagtail: a class-leading content management system: Wagtail

* [Protocol](https://protocol.mozilla.org), Mozila’s design system for the web, to help ensure the sites look and behave like Mozilla sites

* Streamlined infrastructure setup.

This is a documentation-only repo. The codebase for the kit is at <https://github.com/mozmeao/birdbox/>
